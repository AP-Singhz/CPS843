When running this code in a terminal, I made sure to use the "Anaconda" terminal with a "cuda" device to run this code.

Specs:

- Terminal: Anaconda 'conda'

- Device: 'cuda' if found. If not found, the code will use the CPU instead

- Python version: 3.10.9


This project uses many Python libraries for deep learning, image processing as well as image transformation. The following libraries are required to run this project:

    1. Pytorch
    2. OpenCV
    3. Pillow(PIL)
    4. TorchVision

In order to install these libraries, in your terminal, run:

    pip install torch torchvision
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install Pillow

After succesful installation, Navigate to the BarcodeDecoderWithDefectDetection.py file in order to run this in python
